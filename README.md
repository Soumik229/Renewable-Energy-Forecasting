# Renewable-Energy-Forecasting
This project analyzes a renewable energy dataset (2500 rows, 56 columns) combining meteorological and spatial data to identify high-potential zones for clean energy deployment. Using EDA, regression, time-series forecasting, and geospatial mapping, it forecasts energy potential and provides insights for sustainable energy planning.
